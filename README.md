# First and second semester exercises
The folders are seperated for each IDE that I used back then
	
    Visual Studio projects (ProgramiraneLekciiSol, sem2)
	CodeBlocks projects	(_CodeblocksProjects)
	
At the time I was switching IDEs, in orded to find a comfortable one to work and create the needed habits.
I was mainly focused to have a good project organisation.
