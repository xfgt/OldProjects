# First and second semester exercises
The folders are seperated for each IDE that I used back then
	
    Visual Studio projects (ProgramiraneLekciiSol, sem2)
	CodeBlocks projects	(_CodeblocksProjects)
	
At the time I was switching IDEs, in orded to find a comfortable one to work and create the needed habits.
I was mainly focused to have a good project organisation.

### Why not at <a href="https://github.com/xfgt/University-work">University work</a>?
I have more than **100** commits in this folder and I wanted to keep them somehow _( my precious history )_, so I decided it would be a good idea to upload my work as a seperate repository.
